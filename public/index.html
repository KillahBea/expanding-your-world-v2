        Who likes easy plants? <strong>This girl!</strong> Then maaaybe don't start with a succulent.
        Sure, they don't require much attention, but too little attention or too much attention will
        spell certain death. However, a tiny bit of knowledge will lead you down a succulent-filled
        path. While each variety differs in it's basic likes and dislikes there are a few general
        rules to follow.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your soil should be well-draining; excessive moisture will likely cause rot and fungus among
          us.
        </li>
        <li>
          Most succulents are light loving and require sunlight; however, the darker the leaf the more
          shade tolerant the plant.
        </li>
        <li>
          Know your seasons! Like bears, succulents "hibernate". You will water your plant babies more
          often during the growing season and limit their di-hydrogen monoxide in the winter months.
        </li>
        <li>Plants gotta eat, too! Like you, a plant requires nutrients to flourish.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

    <h2>Aloe You Very Much!</h2>
    <p>
      Another reason I favor succulents is due to the large variety in size, shape and color. Some
      of my favorites are:

      <li>
        <h4>String of Pearls</h4>
        <img

          height="200px"
        />
        <p>
          While it is a difficult plant, you will be rewarded by, well what looks like a green
          string of peas. Apparently someone didn't think "String of Peas" sounded fancy enough. I
          guess that makes sense when you consider how this elegant lady trails toward the ground.

        <h4>Lithops</h4>

        <p>
          A small plant that, like many succulents, originates from southern Africa. Most are no
          larger than 2" tall, they can be quite colorful and resemble rocks. But I like them
          because I think they look like little butts. Heh.

          Just like all toads are frogs, but not all frogs are toads; cacti are succulents, too!
          Everyone should have the experience of planting a cactus friend and getting stuck with
          their spines. Hint: plain old tape is your best friend to remove those pesky spines.
